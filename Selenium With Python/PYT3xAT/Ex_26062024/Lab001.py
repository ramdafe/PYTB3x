# Constructors 
# When an object of a class is created, the Constructor helps to initialize the data members/class variables i.e. assigning values to them.

#Types of constructors : 

# default constructor: The default constructor is a simple constructor which doesnâ€™t accept any arguments. Its definition has only one argument which is a reference to the instance being constructed.

# parameterized constructor: constructor with parameters is known as parameterized constructor. The parameterized constructor takes its first argument as a reference to the instance being constructed known as self and the rest of the arguments are provided by the programmer.

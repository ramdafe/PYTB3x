# Task 2
# Leap Year Checker
# Create a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year.
# A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
# Use an if-else statement to make this determination.
# Input = 2024

year = int(input("Enter a year\n"))
print("You have entered ", year)
if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print(f"{year} is a leap year")
        else:
            print(f"{year} is not a leap year")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is a leap year")
